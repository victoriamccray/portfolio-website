                    His artwork can be dated back to at least the early 1990s. </p>

                    <p>Recently, Banksy’s works have been featured in museums.

                        Because of the anonymity of Banksy and his artwork, many have questioned the artist behind a number of recent works.</p>

                        A piece discovered on Northeastern University’s Boston campus.

Many have wondered: Banksy or Bust?

However, the style is not consistent with other works by Banksy…

The Boston piece is simply inspired by Banksy.
